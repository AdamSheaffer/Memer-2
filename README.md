# MEMER

MEMER is similar to other social deduction card games (a la _Apples to Apples_ or _Cards Against Humanity_) except community cards are pulled from the Giphy service and deck cards come from a ever expanding list of content created by the community of players. This means that every game will be new and stay fresh and relevant every time you play.

## How to Play

1. Players get dealt 7 Caption Cards
1. One Player is chosen to be the Judge. The Judge selects from a random set of 4 categories
1. After the judge picks a category, GIPHY selects 8 random gifs. The judge selects 1 gif to be the Community Card
1. All other players select a Caption Card to play on top of the Community Card. A meme gets generated for each player using the Community Card and their selected Caption
1. The Judge selects their favorite meme and the player that submitted the caption scores a point
1. The round resets and the next player becomes the judge
